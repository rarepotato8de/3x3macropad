# 3x3macropad - Build Guide


This guide provides a step-by-step explanation on how to solder/build the macropad.

## Step 1: Empty PCB Backside + Soldering the HS Sockets and LED's
Get the PCB ready

Solder all of the Hotswap-Sockets you need (6 to 9, depending on your desired layout!) and optionally the LED's (The triangle/marked corner on the LED must align with the "triangle" corner on the PCB! It's diagonal from the "1" Text)

## Step 2: Shorten the Arduino Pro Micro Header Pins and Solder it
Split the Header Pins like shown in the picture, since a total of 4 Pins don't have through-holes in the PCB due to the layout

Insert the Header Pins like this in the PCB (for ease: Put the PCB on a table and stick the long side of the Pin Header just a tiny bit more through it)

Place the Pro Micro on it (USB-Port facing towards the PCB!) and solder it's pins

Solder all the pins on the PCB
