----

Can be fully customized and programmed to your needs. It's running QMK or VIAL and has some super cool features!

## Highlights

* 6 (up to 9) Mechanical Switches
* EC11 Encoder (Knob)
* **Hotswap** Sockets
* **OLED Screen**
* RGB **Underglow**
* USB-C Connector (if you choose a USB-C ProMicro!)
* Runs with QMK (VIAL) - freely programmable
* Works with all major OSs, no driver needed

The coolest part of the macropad is the OLED Display on which you can display images, text and small animations<br/>
> [!NOTE]  
> This is an older version, where the screws are on the switch plate. It's only for showcasing the OLED animation

## Required parts

* 6x to 9x Hotswap Sockets
* 1x Arduino Pro Micro
* 1x Bottom plate, 1x PCB, 1x Switch plate
* 4x 10mm M2 Standoffs
* 8x ~5mm M2 Screws
* Mechanical MX Switches
* Keycaps
* optional: 6x SMD WS2812B LED's
* optional: 1x EC11 Encoder (15mm)
* optional: 1x 0.91" OLED Display

## Showcase

> [!NOTE]  
> The newest version of the macropad that is on this GitHub has the screws in the PCB, not the top most switch plate. That means, that some of these pictures show older versions.
Feature wise: They're the same.<br/> The newest version was just optimized for cleaner looks and better mounting for hotswap (previous versions where solder)

### ... and more!

Those are just some examples! You can basically do whatever you want!

## How this Project started

It all started in August 2021 when I had the first contact with custom mechanical keyboards which I've seen on youtube. I was immediately interested since I've been using membrane since I had a PC - never had a mechanical keyboard. So I wanted to get myself a decent mechanical keyboard: The problem was, I wasn't sure on what to get.
So I read myself deeper into this Hobby and was especially interested in creating something myself - PCB's. And I did it!
Started off with reading ai03's PCB guide which is really good and then thought about what would be affordable to make but also nice to use.

Small keyboards (macropads) came in my mind: I've seen some in the past, but they were quite expensive and just not as cool as I would like them to be.
So I wrote down what features I would like to have: OLED, small form factor, Encoder. After that, it was time to design it.

The Layout of this Macropads actually was the first thing I had in mind and it turned out way better than expected when I got my first PCB's.
Besides that, the case-less design was inspired by the custom keyboard I wanted to have at that time: Discipline65 - which I'm using now.
Not only does it look industrial and cool, but it also saves costs for a "dedicated" case.

Shortly after I build my first macropad and shared pictures of it, I noticed that there is quite a high demand for it. So I started offering them.

Now we here. 

In the past weeks I've gotten much love and appreciation from so many people who like my project. Thanks for that! ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ

**2024 Update:** After quite some time I got more into Git(Hub) and since I always loved and used open-source projects myself, I open-sourced this project!
You can now order the PCB's and all other stuff yourself. The PCB files (Gebers) can be uploaded to any PCB Manufacturer (e.g. JLCPCB) and be ordered for very cheap.

Thanks to @mondrian for not only getting yourself 5 macropads, but also for creating the awesome pictures for the [Build Guide](BUILD_GUIDE.md)! ðŸ˜Ž
